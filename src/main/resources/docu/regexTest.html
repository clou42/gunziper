<h1>Regex Test</h1>
<p>Regex Test can be used to build regexes for the scope of e.g. Request Unpacking, or for selecting the part that Match/Replace should replace. <br>
As you can also build the regex right within the burpsuite search fields, the main difference is, that regex test does also highlight the regex group with a different color. </p>
<p>The first step is to send the desired request or/and response to regex test by right click (DON'T just copy and paste the lines into the regex test, as the original \r\n is not copied correctly):</p><br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>After that, just go to desired configuration tab within the gunziper tab and build the regexes. The relevant parts should automatically be higlighted:</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you closed the regex test window, you can access it again from each configuration window with the regex test button (the content of the regex test persists ):</p>
